# The Draconomicon

## Introduction
The dragon reared, roaring, clawing at air
And belching fire, and began to lunge down
Upon Dydd, but the druid slashed into
Ashardalon’s heart, her scimitar cut
And the lifeblood began to spill. Then Dydd
Was slain, her heart wrested from her breast by
The dragon’s grasping jaws, swallowed, consumed
To sustain Ashardalon’s ebbing life
For a time. . . .
    —The Lay of Dydd

                                 (TRANSLATED)

          WHERE POSSIBLE, the Editor has taken every oppurtunity to find the
original Summerian or Akkadian translation of a given Greek charm or conjura-
tion.  These will be given here.  Also, the reader will find English transla-
tions of the Sumerian charms as they are given in the NECRONOMICON.  Not all
of the charms are avaliable in this way, and sometimes we have had to make do
with near misses.  Much of what is found here is from the MAKLU text, of which
only extant translation is in German or Tallqvist.  The word "maklu" or
"maqlu" itself is controversial, but Tallqvist seems to think that it does,
indeed, mean "burning"; especially so as the incantations to be found therin
invaribly entail burning something, usually a doll made in the likeness of a
witch or evil sorcerer that the magician wished to dispose of.  Hence, we have
here probably the archetype of the Great Burning Times of the Inquisition,
when people were condemmed to firey deaths as Witches and Pagans.  The chant
"burn!witch!burn!" can be found in the MAKLU text, in all its pristine glory.
  Indeed, Cthulhu Calls.

# Original
AJ Azif - In Arabic, written by Abd al-Hazrad, c. 730 A.D. Original form is unknown but 
numerous manuscript versions were long circulated among various medieval scholars. As early as the 
12th century this version was referred to as lost.
