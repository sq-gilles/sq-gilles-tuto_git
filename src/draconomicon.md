# The Draconomicon

## Introduction
The dragon reared, roaring, clawing at air
And belching fire, and began to lunge down
Upon Dydd, but the druid slashed into
Ashardalon’s heart, her scimitar cut
And the lifeblood began to spill. Then Dydd
Was slain, her heart wrested from her breast by
The dragon’s grasping jaws, swallowed, consumed
To sustain Ashardalon’s ebbing life
For a time. . . .
